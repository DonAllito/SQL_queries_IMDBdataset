# SQL_queries_IMDBdataset
lets do some Query on IMDB 1.5G dataset.
In this project, I ran a number of optimized queries on the imdb database, the goal was to answer some of the questions asked by the project designer, and finally we were able to answer about 10 questions through queries. The size of the database was about one and a half gigabytes, and the data of all movies over 100 years old can be accommodated through different tables.
